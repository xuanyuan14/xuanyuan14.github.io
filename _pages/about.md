I am now a first year Ph.D. student in [THUIR](http://www.thuir.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing, China. Before joining THU, I received the B.Eng.(2019) M.Eng.(2022) in South China University of Technology (SCUT) and Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) respectively.
My supervisor is Prof. [Shaoping Ma](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~msp/), Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/) and Prof. [Qingyao Ai](https://ir.aiqingyao.org/home). My major research interests are about text retrieval/reranking, recommendation, knowledge enhanced pretrained language models for IR, etc.
